# BrainWork

===

BrainWork was a student project created by Antoine Gagnon, Cyril Nouvet and Damien Sourdon during a math project.

Our aim was to create a tool that could represent how would a Turing machine work. This tool would later help us teach younger student about algorithm and how the Turing machine was the concept that brought the idea of computers to the world.

### User manual

This tool is using the BrainFuck language, you can find how to write it [here]

Our tool is using numbers and converting them to their ASCII counterpart, if the number is under 33, the program will display the number and not the ASCII character since those are whitespaces and other invisible characters.

To get started, you can either start right away with BrainFuck code, you just have to make your input start with the ":" or you can add value to the scroll by placing them before the ":" and by separating them with whitespaces.

Press start, change the delay between each step on the slide bar and your program should be ready to work.


If you have any question feel free to ask me.

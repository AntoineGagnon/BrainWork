# BrainWork

===

BrainWork was a student project created by Antoine Gagnon, Cyril Nouvet and Damien Sourdon during a math project.

Our aim was to create a tool that could represent how would a Turing machine work. This tool would later help us teach younger student about algorithm and how the Turing machine was the concept that brought the idea of computers to the world.

### Download it 

To download it you can either use the "Download as zip" option if you want the whole source code or you can check our public releases here : https://github.com/AntoineGagnon/BrainWork/releases

### User manual

This tool is using the BrainFuck language, you can find how to write it [here]

Our tool is using numbers and converting them to their ASCII counterpart, if the number is under 33, the program will display the number and not the ASCII character since those are whitespaces and other invisible characters.

To get started, you can either start right away with BrainFuck code or you can add value to the scroll by placing them separated by whitespaces and followed by a ":" to start writing the algorithm code

Press start, change the delay between each step on the slide bar and your program should be ready to work.
    
A small example that multiply the value 1 by the value 2 :


    1 2: <[>[->+>+<<]>>[-<<+>>]<<<]>>. 

If you have any question feel free to ask me.
